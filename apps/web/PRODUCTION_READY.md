# Production Readiness Checklist

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must fix before ANY production deployment)

### Security Issues
- [ ] **Authentication System** - Currently NO authentication at all
  - Anyone can create/modify/delete ALL projects
  - Need: NextAuth.js with OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
  - Need: Session management and protected routes
  
- [ ] **Database** - Currently using JSON file storage
  - Risk: Data loss, corruption, no concurrent access control
  - Need: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
  - Need: Proper migrations and backups
  
- [ ] **Input Validation** - No validation on API endpoints
  - Risk: SQL injection, XSS, data corruption
  - Need: Zod schemas for all inputs
  - Need: Sanitization of user content
  
- [ ] **File Upload Security**
  - Files stored in `/public` directory (world accessible!)
  - No file type validation (can upload executables)
  - No size limits (DoS vulnerability)
  - Need: Private S3/R2 storage with signed URLs
  - Need: Virus scanning, type validation, size limits

- [ ] **API Security**
  - No rate limiting (DoS vulnerability)
  - No CORS configuration
  - World-readable data file (644 permissions)
  - Need: Rate limiting with Redis
  - Need: Proper CORS headers
  - Need: API key authentication for external access

## ðŸŸ¡ MAJOR FEATURES (Core functionality missing)

- [ ] **Composer/AI Generation** - The MAIN feature doesn't exist
  - Need: OpenRouter API integration
  - Need: Real-time generation UI
  - Need: Progress tracking and cancellation
  
- [ ] **User Management**
  - No way to separate user data
  - No user profiles or settings
  - Need: User dashboard, profile management
  
- [ ] **Admin Panel** - Currently just static HTML
  - Need: Real admin functionality
  - Need: User management, content moderation
  - Need: Analytics and monitoring
  
- [ ] **Payment System**
  - Premium features referenced but not implemented
  - Need: Stripe integration
  - Need: Subscription management
  
- [ ] **Templates System**
  - All hardcoded with placeholder images
  - Need: Dynamic template loading
  - Need: Template marketplace

## ðŸŸ  QUALITY ISSUES

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Basic or missing error boundaries
  - No user-friendly error messages
  - Need: Global error boundary
  - Need: Sentry error tracking
  
- [ ] **Testing**
  - ZERO test coverage
  - Need: Unit tests (min 80% coverage)
  - Need: Integration tests
  - Need: E2E tests with Playwright
  
- [ ] **Performance**
  - No optimization
  - No caching strategy
  - No CDN setup
  - Need: Image optimization
  - Need: Redis caching
  - Need: CDN for static assets
  
- [ ] **Mobile Experience**
  - Components exist but untested
  - Need: Responsive testing
  - Need: Touch gesture support
  
- [ ] **Accessibility**
  - Basic implementation only
  - Need: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Need: Screen reader testing

## ðŸ”µ MINOR ISSUES

- [ ] Sentry warnings (missing instrumentation files)
- [ ] Multiple redundant background processes
- [ ] Hardcoded placeholder content everywhere
- [ ] Inconsistent styling and UI patterns
- [ ] Missing loading states and skeletons
- [ ] No pagination for lists

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Critical Security (2 weeks)
- Authentication system
- Database migration
- Secure file storage
- Input validation

### Phase 2: Core Features (4 weeks)
- AI Composer implementation
- User management
- Real templates system
- Basic admin panel

### Phase 3: Production Ready (3 weeks)
- Payment integration
- Testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Error handling

### Phase 4: Polish (1 week)
- Mobile optimization
- Accessibility
- Documentation
- Deployment setup

**Total: 10 weeks minimum for production-ready state**

## Current State: PROTOTYPE ONLY
This is an early prototype that demonstrates the concept but is NOT suitable for:
- Production deployment
- Real users
- Handling real data
- Public access

## Immediate Actions Required
1. DISABLE public access immediately
2. Add authentication before ANY external testing
3. Move data to proper database
4. Implement security measures
